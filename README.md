2) If we want to change the dummy runs and the actual timed executions change the options -f , -t respectively.
3) If we want to change the destination directory of the sorted data and the JSON data which contains the execution time, change the options -d, -r respectively.
4) To change the algorithm for the sorting program, use the option -a (0 - Insertion Sort, 1 - Merge Sort (Default), 2 - Tim Sort )
